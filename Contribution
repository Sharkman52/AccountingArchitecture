               The purpose of our changes to the accounting architecture is to inform the 
               reader about the origins of the open source movement and why it's important 
               for accountants to understand how to use open source software. 
               We also included information about the benefits of open source over proprietary
               software, these being ease of use, reduced costs, and a more dynamic system that can better suit the user. 
               In some instances, firms will wait for proprietary software companies to release a patch if software doesn't meet their exact requirements. 
               Open source in much faster at issuing changes to allow individual firms a chance to customize their software.
